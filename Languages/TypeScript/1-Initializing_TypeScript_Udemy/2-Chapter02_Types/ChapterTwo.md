# Class Guidelines

For JavaScript and what Type inherited:  
1) Every character declared between ' ' is string;  
2) All numbers, even those with floating point are of type number;  
3) Boolean will be boolean in both cases  

 **typeof:** Determines the type;  
 With a dynamic variable I can apply any value, that the compiler will accept it,
 be it string, number or boolean, for example:  

~~~js
let minhaIdade;
minhaIdade = 36;
console.log(typeof minhaIdade);
minhaIdade = '36';
